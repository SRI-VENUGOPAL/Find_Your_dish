z-index:
here to make the image go behind so it does not take space.

This is an advanced css concept:

Basic code:

<div class="red"> RED
</div>
<div class="yellow"> yellow
</div>
<div class="blue">blue
</div>

div{
height: 100px;
width: 100px;
border:1px solid;
}
.red{
background-color: red;
}
.yellow{
background-color: yellow;
}
.blue{
background-color: blue;
}

the easiest way to put one element over the other is by nesting.
so, we put the yellow div inside the red div as below. so, yellow div
sits on the red div since it become a child of the red div.

<div class="red"> RED
<div class="yellow"> yellow
</div>
</div>
<div class="blue">blue
</div>

div{
height: 100px;
width: 100px;
border:1px solid;
}
.red{
background-color: red;
}
.yellow{
background-color: yellow;
}
.blue{
background-color: blue;
}

Now consider the basic code:

position: absolute; takes the element out of the flow.
when this is first added to the div{} in css. only the blue div will be seen.
it is just that since all three is of same size. yellow and red are below the blue div.
and all the three div are taken out of the flow. This is without nesting

div{
height: 100px;
width: 100px;
border:1px solid;
position: absolute;
}

now if I add left and top of 40px and 20px for the blue and yellow div along with position alternate.
the div will be stacked above one another.
.yellow{
background-color: yellow;
left: 20px;
top: 20px;
}
.blue{
background-color: blue;
left: 40px;
top: 40px;
}

Now if I want the yellow div to be on top:

<div class="red"> RED
</div>
<div class="blue">blue
</div>
<div class="yellow"> yellow
</div>

div{
height: 100px;
width: 100px;
border:1px solid;
}
.red{
background-color: red;
}
.yellow{
background-color: yellow;
left: 20px;
top: 20px;
}
.blue{
background-color: blue;
left: 40px;
top: 40px;
}


In order to change the stacking order without changing the div in html manually.
For this the CSS property called z-index is used. It is one of the properties which can change the stacking order.
The default z-index is zero.
It only works when position is explicitly set.

code:
z-index: 1; to bring the bottom to top
z-index: -1; to push to the bottom

the basic code put the red behind yellow behind blue.

First:
.red{
background-color: red;
z-index= 1;
}

this pushes the red to be on top nd nearest to the user with blue behind it followed by yellow.
red---blue--yellow.

Second:

.blue{
background-color: blue;
left: 40px;
top: 40px;
z-index: -1;
}

this pushes the blue to be behind the yellow unlink the last time where blue was above yellow.
